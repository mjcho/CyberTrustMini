## Information Trustworthiness
>- An open research question!
>- 1. Database, machine learning, and natural language understanding
  - data/knowledge fusion
  - data veracity and source credibility
>- 2. Computational journalism 
  - automated fact-checking: also an engineering question?
  - combining currently available tools vs. "fundamental breakthroughs in multiple fronts"

---

## Factiness, Truthiness
>- 1. True/False value of a claim is importent, but...
  - It's not only about fact; it's also about the possiblity of having some "facts"
  - Nathan Jurgenson: "The facts of Obamaâ€™s birthplace mattered less..."
>- 2. Facts vs. "facty" info
  - "Factiness is the taste for the feel and aesthetic of 'facts'" 
  - We like to be informed, like, super informed: "facty" info is attractive whether it true or not

## Cyber Social Project and Information Trustworthiness
>- 1. Consumer-side media diet
  - Info presented vs. Info consumed
>- 2. Moment-by-moment granularity
  - Naturally-occurring data
>- 3. Duke Database Research Group's ClaimBuster
  - SVM trained on presidential debate texts
  - Has a REST API
